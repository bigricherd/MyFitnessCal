WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 27)
- implemented logout (app/routes/authRoutes.js)
- modified navbar to render different links depending on whether a user is logged in
    - simple hook in App.js to fetch the currently logged in user and display that data as debug text for now
- added success message that displays on form submit for AddSet and AddExercise
    - we query the DB to ensure that the most recent row matches what the user entered
    - only send success message if row and user-entered data match

WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 25)
- implemented auth using passport.js. see:
    - Backend:
        - app/routes/authRoutes.js
        - app/utils/middlware.js
        - app/utils/passportLocal.js --- this is where the meat of the implementation is
    - Frontend:
        - app/client/src/components/Register.jsx
        - app/client/src/components/Login.jsx
        - app/client/src/hooks/authFormControl.js -- just a copy of useForm.js but customized for Register and Login forms
- added client-side routing using BrowserRouter from react-router-dom
- added temporary Navbar (see app/client/src/components/Nav.jsx)
- added 'owner' attribute to set schema as a foreign key that references appUser.id (see setup.sql)
- modified all Set and Stat routes to include the owner attribute (see app/client/routes)

------ GENERAL NOTES ------

- probably don't want to be logging req.user.password or even storing the password at all (?)

FRONTEND
- <Dropdown/> components are only selectors, the form submits the value of the hidden inputs below each of the dropdowns
    - exercise in AddSet
    - muscleGroup in AddExercise
- AddSet: date field is not a date picker, just a text input 

BACKEND
- all database operations abstracted to app/utils/dbModule.js

DATABASE
- no whitespaces pls, only underscores because Postgres puts double quotes around anything with whitespace
- enums values are all in lowercase
- Exercise enum is stored as “exercise:muscleGroup” e.g. “bench_press:chest”
- There is still a separate muscleGroup enum, stored simply as “muscleGroup” e.g. “chest”
