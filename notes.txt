FRONTEND
- <Dropdown/> components are only selectors, the form submits the value of the hidden inputs below each of the dropdowns
    - exercise in AddSet
    - muscleGroup in AddExercise
- AddSet: date field is not a date picker, just a text input 

BACKEND
- consider: refactor so that there are as little database connections as possible
    - i.e. move all calls to client.query() to one file

DATABASE
- no whitespaces pls, only underscores because Postgres puts double quotes around anything with whitespace
- enums values are all in lowercase
- Exercise enum is stored as “exercise:muscleGroup” e.g. “bench_press:chest”
- There is still a separate muscleGroup enum, stored simply as “muscleGroup” e.g. “chest”
