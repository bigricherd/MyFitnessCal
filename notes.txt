WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 29)
- organized setup.sql to be runnable in one go (hopefully, TODO: before you commit, try with postgres database)
- updated filter route (app/routes/statRoutes.js -- get('/setsPerMuscle)) a little bit
    - added documentation
    - added fetching average weight and reps, maximum weight for matching sets
        - display this extra data in src/components/tables/NumSetsTable.jsx
- added TODO:s in src/components/forms/AddSet.jsx to represent decisions on clearing form fields on submit
- 

WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 28)
- organized src/components directory in app/client into Pages, Forms, and Tables where applicable
- abstracted fetching of Exercises and muscleGroups enums out of AddSet and AddExercise form components
    - instead fetched in src/components/pages/Forms.jsx and passed as props into the two forms
    - Exercises Dropdown in AddSet does not update after AddExercise adds an exercise
        - UNLESS we go to a different route like Filters, then come back to Forms
- renamed authFormControl to useAuthForm (src/components/hooks/useAuthForm.js)
- shows 'Register or Login' first if a user visits the Forms, Filters, or Home pages
    - probably better practice to redirect them to a single page (?)
        - however, user is passed as props to the page components
        - if we redirect when there is no user, we may end up always redirecting since the component is rendered with state variable user = null
- implemented Volume Counter: show total number of sets for some date range for selected muscle group
    - also shows breakdown of sets per exercise for selected muscle group
    - see:
        - Backend:
           - app/routes/statRoutes.js
        - Frontend:
            - app/client/src/components/pages/Filter.jsx
            - app/client/src/components/forms/MuscleGroupFilter.jsx
            - app/client/src/components/tables/NumSetsTable.jsx
            - app/client/src/hooks/useFilterForm.js -- another variant of useForm, like useAuthForm is, except this one sends a GET request.
    


WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 27)
- implemented logout (app/routes/authRoutes.js)
- modified navbar to render different links depending on whether a user is logged in
    - simple hook in App.js to fetch the currently logged in user and display that data as debug text for now
- added success message that displays on form submit for AddSet and AddExercise
    - we query the DB to ensure that the most recent row matches what the user entered
    - only send success message if row and user-entered data match

WHAT'S NEW (JUNE 25)
- implemented auth using passport.js. see:
    - Backend:
        - app/routes/authRoutes.js
        - app/utils/middlware.js
        - app/utils/passportLocal.js --- this is where the meat of the implementation is
    - Frontend:
        - app/client/src/components/Register.jsx
        - app/client/src/components/Login.jsx
        - app/client/src/hooks/authFormControl.js -- just a copy of useForm.js but customized for Register and Login forms
- added client-side routing using BrowserRouter from react-router-dom
- added temporary Navbar (see app/client/src/components/Nav.jsx)
- added 'owner' attribute to set schema as a foreign key that references appUser.id (see setup.sql)
- modified all Set and Stat routes to include the owner attribute (see app/client/routes)

------ GENERAL NOTES ------

- probably don't want to be logging req.user.password or even storing the password at all (?)

FRONTEND
- <Dropdown/> components are only selectors, the form submits the value of the hidden inputs below each of the dropdowns
    - exercise in AddSet
    - muscleGroup in AddExercise
- AddSet: date field is not a date picker, just a text input 

BACKEND
- all database operations abstracted to app/utils/dbModule.js

DATABASE
- no whitespaces pls, only underscores because Postgres puts double quotes around anything with whitespace
- enums values are all in lowercase
- Exercise enum is stored as “exercise:muscleGroup” e.g. “bench_press:chest”
- There is still a separate muscleGroup enum, stored simply as “muscleGroup” e.g. “chest”
